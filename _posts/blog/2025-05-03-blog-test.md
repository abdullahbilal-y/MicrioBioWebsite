## Drive traffic and conversions with a free blog maker.

Starting a blog is one of the most efficient ways to drive traffic to your website and build customer relationships. However, creating a blog on a traditional CMS platform can be challenging — requiring third-party providers and manual security updates.

With Content Hub, everything you need to create and scale a successful blog is built in. Use themes and a visual editor to design your blog. Start publishing engaging content immediately with integrated SEO recommendations while HubSpot provides monitoring and hosting.

3. ### Turn blog traffic into new business.

   Driving traffic to your blog is great, but it won’t impact your bottom line unless you can turn those clicks into customers. With HubSpot’s free blog maker, you can use custom CTAs and lead forms to capture new leads and leverage in-depth reporting to determine the content types with the best ROI.
